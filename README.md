## Analyzing the Correlation Between Sex, Vaccine Brand, and Adverse Events After COVID-19 Vaccination
## Team 08: Adeline Schwartz, Anusha Kumar, Connor Thropp, Lindsey Ross, Ziyin Li

### Project Overview
This repository contains code used to analyze 2021 COVID-19 Data from VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System). The covariates used to analyze COVID-19 data in our project are identified, such as sex, vaccine brand (Moderna and Pfizer vaccines), and the top three adverse events. We are able to assess whether a significant correlation exists among these three variables. The additional examination of other covariates such as age and onset data helps in understanding the onset of symptoms associated with COVID-19 vaccination. This assists with determining relationships between onset interval and range of ages for Males/Females given Moderna/Pfizer. We are also able to understand the urgency associated with the top three adverse events and the relationship with age. Our results can assist medical professionals/vaccine manufacturers in understanding how to better market their vaccines, and may be useful for machine learning systems in the future.
