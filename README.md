## Analyzing the Correlation Between Sex, Vaccine Brand, and Adverse Events After COVID-19 Vaccination
## Team 08: Adeline Schwartz, Anusha Kumar, Connor Thropp, Lindsey Ross, Ziyin Li

### Project Overview
This repository contains code used to analyze COVID-19 Data from VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System). The specfic covariates used to analyze COVID-19 data in our project are identified, such as sex, vaccine brand, and the top three adverse events (for Moderna and Pfizer vaccines). We are able to assess whether a significant correlation exists among these three variables. The additional examination of other covariates such as age and onset data helps in understanding the onset of symptoms associated with COVID-19 vaccination. Such information is useful for medical professionals and vaccine manufacturers to understand how to better market their vaccines.
